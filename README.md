# St. Petersburg paradox grapher

## WHY

This program is intended to help study [St. Petersburg paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg_paradox).
In this paradox, one should play the game at any price if offered the opportunity, for the mathematical expected value being infinity.
Yet, many people expressed disbelief in the result.
We think this is because the less number of game playd, the less average earing can be gained, which is what we want to test.

## WHAT

- Play the game n-times with changing n.
- Calculate average earing per game.
- Plot the result.

## HOW TO USE

```bash
script/bootstrap # only for macOS users
make             # res.png will be created
```
